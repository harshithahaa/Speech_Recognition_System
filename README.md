# Speech_Recognition_System
This project delivers a lightweight yet accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that converts English speech from .wav audio files into written text. It uses the Wav2Vec2.0 Base 960h model developed by Facebook AI, integrated with PyTorch, torchaudio, and Hugging Face Transformers for a complete and efficient pipeline.
